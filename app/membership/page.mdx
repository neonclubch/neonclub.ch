<div className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground/45 leading-relaxed mb-16">
The <em>Clubsterben</em> is not a trend; it is a controlled demolition of our social fabric. If you are here for early-bird tickets or "members-only" perks, you are in the wrong place.

<h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-foreground/90 mb-1">THE CONTRIBUTION: CHF 35.—</h2>

<div className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground/45 leading-relaxed">
We do not sell memberships; we collect resources for cultural defense. Your 35 francs are not a transaction—they are a contribution to the survival of the Urban Vacuum. This fund fuels our nomadic sound systems, bypasses the barriers of the real estate market, and keeps the experiment alive.

<div className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground/45 leading-relaxed mb-8">
Even more than your money, we need your presence. A rave is not something you watch; it is something you <em>are</em>. To truly preserve the Social Alchemy of the night, we require the "Prosumer"—the active participant who co-creates the space.
</div>

<div className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground/45 leading-relaxed mb-16">
We don't want your passive support; we want your labor, your ideas, and your physical energy. Whether it is moving speakers into a secret warehouse, designing a tactical intervention, or protecting a safe space on the dancefloor—your time is the only currency that cannot be inflated or regulated.

By joining NEON, you are signing up for a mission of Radical Solidarity. You are choosing to be a part of the movement that transcends the four walls of the traditional club.
