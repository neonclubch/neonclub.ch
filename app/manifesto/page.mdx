## Hey There, Party People!
Welcome to NEON! If you're wondering, that stands for "Neue Elektronische Organisation für Nachtkultur." But let’s be real, nobody’s got time for that mouthful. We’re just NEON, your go-to crew for everything awesome in the electronic music scene in Zurich. We're here to support artists, throw epic events, and spread the good vibes. And guess what? We’re all about sustainability, tolerance, and—of course—killer tunes.


## Our Vision
Imagine a Zurich where electronic music rules the night, artists get the love they deserve, and the community is one big, happy (and slightly sweaty) family. That's what we’re all about. We’re on a mission to make Zurich the brightest spot on the electronic music map.

## Our MissionWe’ve got a three-step plan to make this dream a reality:
1. **Boost Electronic Music**: We’re all about giving artists the stage, the support, and the spotlight.
2. **Throw Unforgettable Parties**: Our events are more than just nights out—they’re experiences.
3. **Spread the Knowledge**: From sustainability tips to music industry hacks, we’ve got the info you need.
4. **Team Up**: We love collaborating with other awesome groups to keep the good times rolling.

## Our Core Values (aka What Makes Us Tick)
### 1. Music
Duh, right? But we take our tunes seriously.
- **Artist Love**: We support artists like they’re our favorite DJs (because they are).
- **Fresh Beats**: We’re always on the hunt for new sounds and innovative vibes.
- **Community**: Music isn’t just sound—it’s a family affair.

### 2. Sustainability
Yep, we’re the tree-huggers of the nightlife scene. But in a cool way!
- **Eco-friendly Events**: Think reusable cups, no plastic straws, and energy-efficient everything, or at least, as much as possible.
- **Green Education**: We’ll teach you how to party hard without hurting Mother Earth.
- **Planet-friendly Partnerships**: We team up with others who love the planet as much as we do.

### 3. Tolerance
Music is for everyone, and we mean everyone.
- **Inclusivity**: Our dance floors are safe spaces for all. No exceptions.
- **Diversity**: We celebrate every beat, every style, every person.
- **No Jerks Allowed**: Discrimination? Not on our watch.

## Our Game Plan
###Support Artists
- **Residency Programs**: We’re like your cool aunt’s guest room, but for artists.
- **Workshops and Masterclasses**: Learn from the best to be the best.
- **Networking**: Meet the people who can make your music dreams come true.

### Throw Epic Events
- **Signature Events**: Regular parties that you won’t want to miss.
- **Collab Events**: We love a good team-up for unique, unforgettable nights.
- **Green Parties**: Party hard, but leave the Earth better than we found it.

### Spread the Love
- **Publications**: From newsletters to blogs, we’ve got the scoop.
- **Social Media**: Follow us for the latest news and some serious FOMO.
- **Workshops and Talks**: Get smart about music production, sustainability, and more.

### Team Up
- **Partnerships**: We’re better together. Let’s join forces.
